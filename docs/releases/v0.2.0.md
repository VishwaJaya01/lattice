# Lattice v0.2.0

Release focus: FlashAudit operator controls and validation hardening.

## Highlights

- Added FlashAudit stream controls:
  - `p` pause/resume outbound streaming
  - `x` cancel stream (control-plane cancel message)
- Added FlashAudit snapshot support:
  - `s` writes a session snapshot text file
- Added FlashAudit append output mode:
  - `--out <path>` appends cracked lines as `username:plaintext`
- Updated operator docs and demo validation checklist.

## Validation Gates

The following commands were used as release gates:

```bash
cargo test -p rainbowkv -p lattice-input
go test ./cmd/lattice-orchestrator -count=1
./scripts/smoke-e2e.sh
./scripts/chaos-demo.sh
```

## Notes

- This release keeps the same core architecture and focuses on operator UX and reliability workflows.
- Existing mTLS, failover, observability, and TLA+ assets remain part of the validated portfolio baseline.
